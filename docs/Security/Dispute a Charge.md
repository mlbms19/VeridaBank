# How do I dispute a charge?

You can dispute a charge if you believe a transaction on your account is unauthorized. 

Disputes help protect you from improper billing and prevent further fraudulent transactions.

1.	Go to **Account** > **Charges** > **Dispute Center**.
2.	Fill in the requested details under **Dispute a Charge** (e.g., transaction date, amount, reason for dispute).
3.	Click (or tap) **Submit**.
